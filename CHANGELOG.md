### Analysis

#### DASE Integration Assessment
- **DASE_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive feasibility study
- Analyzed DASE (Discrete Analog Simulation Engine) at `D:\isoG\New-folder\sase_amp_fixed`
- Identified architectural mismatch: DASE is analog circuit simulator, not constraint solver
- Evaluated 4 integration options (IGSOA Adapter, Phase 4B, Native Rust, Hybrid)
- **Recommendation:** Implement native Rust solver for color-space metrics
- Future research opportunity: IGSOA quantum-inspired physics for color reasoning

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added - Milestone 1: Chromatic Tensor Core

#### Core Tensor System
- **ChromaticTensor** struct with 4D RGB tensor and 3D certainty weights
- Deterministic random initialization via `from_seed()` using LCG
- Zero initialization via `new()`
- Construction from existing arrays via `from_arrays()`
- `normalize()` method to clamp values to [0.0, 1.0]
- `clamp()` method for arbitrary range limiting
- `statistics()` method for mean RGB, variance, and certainty analysis
- `Display` trait implementation for readable tensor summaries
- Arithmetic operators: `Add` and `Sub` with certainty averaging

#### Primitive Operations
- **mix()** - Additive coherence with normalization
- **filter()** - Subtractive distinction with clamping
- **complement()** - 180° hue rotation (inverts G and B channels)
- **saturate()** - Chroma adjustment by scaling deviation from mean
- All operations parallelized with rayon
- Automatic operation logging to JSON

#### Gradient Projection
- **GradientLayer** for certainty-weighted 3D → 2D projection
- PNG export via plotters backend
- `to_png()` method for visualization output
- Automatic directory creation for output files

#### Configuration System
- TOML-based configuration via `EngineConfig`
- Fields: rows, cols, layers, seed, device
- `load_from_file()` for loading config files
- `from_str()` for parsing TOML strings
- Sensible defaults (64×64×8, seed 42, CPU)
- Graceful fallback to defaults on error

#### Logging Infrastructure
- JSON line-delimited logging format (JSONL)
- **OperationLogEntry** with timestamp, statistics, and operation name
- **TrainingLogEntry** with iteration, loss, and metrics
- Separate log files: `logs/operations.jsonl` and `logs/run.jsonl`
- Automatic log directory creation
- Non-blocking logging (errors printed to stderr)

#### Training Support
- **TrainingMetrics** struct with loss and tensor statistics
- **mse_loss()** function for mean squared error computation
- Parallelized loss calculation with rayon
- Integration with logging system

#### Testing
- Unit tests for all operations (mix, filter, complement, saturate)
- Gradient layer projection tests
- MSE loss computation tests
- Test utilities for creating sample tensors
- All 6 tests passing

#### Examples & Demos
- `examples/demo.rs` showcasing full pipeline:
  - Config loading
  - Tensor initialization
  - Operation chaining (mix → filter → complement → saturate)
  - Gradient projection and PNG export
  - Loss computation and logging

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with Quick Start guide
- Architecture documentation in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- API reference in `docs/API.md`
- Inline rustdoc comments on all public APIs
- Code examples in documentation

#### Project Infrastructure
- Cargo.toml with all dependencies
- .gitignore for Rust projects (target/, out/, logs/)
- TOML config file: `config/engine.toml`
- Example output directories: out/, logs/

### Fixed

- **Cargo.toml**: Changed edition from "2024" to "2021"
- **Cargo.toml**: Added missing `toml` dependency for config parsing
- **Cargo.toml**: Fixed plotters features (`bitmap_backend`, `bitmap_encoder`)
- **chromatic_tensor.rs**: Replaced `axis_iter_mut` with direct indexing in `complement()`
- **chromatic_tensor.rs**: Replaced `axis_iter_mut` with direct indexing in `saturate()`
- **chromatic_tensor.rs**: Fixed `statistics()` to handle non-contiguous arrays
- **operations.rs**: Replaced deprecated `par_apply` with `par_for_each`
- **tests/operations.rs**: Corrected gradient_layer test expectations

### Dependencies

- ndarray 0.15 (N-dimensional arrays with rayon support)
- rayon 1.8 (Data parallelism)
- serde 1.0 (Serialization framework)
- serde_json 1.0 (JSON serialization)
- toml 0.8 (TOML configuration parsing)
- plotters 0.3 (PNG visualization)

### Performance
