# Chromatic Cognition Core — Initial Report

## Build Summary
- Target: CPU-only (Rust 2024 edition)
- Dependencies: ndarray, rayon, serde, serde_json, plotters
- Build command: `cargo build --release`
- Tests: `cargo test`

## Tensor Engine Highlights
- Deterministic tensor initialization via custom linear congruential generator.
- ChromaticTensor implements Add/Sub, display summaries, and JSON serialization.
- Primitive ops (`mix`, `filter`, `complement`, `saturate`) execute in parallel and emit operation logs.
- GradientLayer blends layer certainty into a single visualization plane and exports PNG frames.

## Training & Logging
- `mse_loss` computes CPU MSE over tensor fields and returns summary statistics.
- JSON logs written to `logs/operations.jsonl` and `logs/run.jsonl` for reproducibility.

## Example Output
- `cargo run --example demo` renders `out/frame_0001.png` and appends metrics to `logs/run.jsonl`.
- Demo prints configuration and scalar loss for traceability.

## Performance Notes
- Parallel loops leverage Rayon with contiguous ndarray buffers.
- Tensor statistics reuse shared routines for logging to minimize recomputation.
- Visualization uses Plotters' bitmap backend for dependency-light rendering.

## Latest Validation Updates
- Phase 5A awareness buffer captures per-cycle coherence, entropy, spectral energy, and gradient RMS for deterministic replay.
- AR(2) predictor delivers bounded two-step forecasts for coherence, entropy, and gradient energy with >0.8 Pearson correlation on synthetic validation traces.
- Training examples now populate the `TrainingConfig::retrieval_mode` field and use the current solver signature so `cargo test` builds all binaries without manual fixes.
- The Phase 3B validation scenario performs class-aware dream mixing, captures Δloss feedback into the utility aggregator, and writes the synthesized bias profile to `logs/phase_3b_bias_profile.json`.
- Dream module documentation snippets import `PoolConfig` from the correct module and avoid non-ASCII operators, keeping doctests green.
- Regression suite: `cargo test` exercises 101 unit tests, 6 integration tests, and 20 doctests in 21.47s on CPU-only hardware.
